## What is the Machine Learning?
> Machine learning is a field of computer science that often uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to "learn" (i.e., progressively improve performance on a specific task) with data, without being explicitly programmed. -- Wikipedia

We can find three things from the defination:

>- uses statistical techniques;
- the ability to "learn";
- without being explicitly programmed;

Using statistical techniques means we need to use mathematical method to find the best function to solve our problem.

Giving computers the ability to "learn" means we need to help computers use mathematical.

Without being explicitly programmed means we do not need to write the steps for computers.

So, we can say "Machine Learning â‰ˆ Looking for a Function".

## Classification of Machine Learning
We can divide machine learning into serveral categories:
>- Supervised Learning
>>- Regression
>>- Classification
>>>- Linear Model
>>>- Non-linear Model
>>>>- Deep Learning
>>>>- SVM...

and

>- Unsupervised Learning
>>- Semi-supervised Learning
>>- Transfer Learning
>>- Unsupervised Learning
>>- Reinforcement Learning
