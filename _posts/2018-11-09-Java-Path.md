So, what is the path for? When you compile java classes, you need to tell the computer where the Java tools are and tell JDK where your class files are. So, we need set JAVA_HOME, PATH, CLASSPATH variables.

Let's have a look of what's the meaning of these three variables:

>JAVA_HOME: Java install directory.
>PATH: If you set PATH here, you can run the executables conveniently without inputing the full path.
>CLASSPATH: Tells the JDK where to find the class files.
